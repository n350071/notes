## beyond the team boundary
人々は、自分のタスクなり責任範囲に閉じこもりがち。
でも、全員がプロダクトの成功のために関わっているはず。
まずは自分が責任範囲を超えて、誰もやらないタスク・考慮事項をなくすことで、失敗原因を消す。

I agree with the idea that people who work as agile should respect each others.

This idea is sometimes different expression, HRT / Psychological safety.

If there is no psychological safety, our brain performance should be down, and not happy.
So, it cause Project fail and People leave from it.


### Safety
In the modern agile, he proposes 4 of principle.
The one is Safe.
It includes not only test code / CI but also psychological safety.

### Even if the product looks success, if someone is not happy, it will be fail.
If team member is happy, they would work with the future of the product.
But, if member don't like their team, do you believe their work for continuous success ?
