# Design Doc

## Idea
- 抽象に依存せよ、それはドキュメントにおいても

- Write What, Why, How we will make.
- Don't write too much details.

## advice
Whether you write it, ask question with this idea helps you to understand the project quickly. But, Why not you write it after you asked? even you will decrease the time when new comer join in?
Write concrete will cause to change the document, write the abstract is safe. so, you should't write too much.
